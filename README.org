* simple math tutorial test for kids
its supposed to work a bit like chatting with a bot
and could maybe be elnodeified

i looked around for an existing solution but didnt find any that
wasnt replete with jumping penguins, flash animations, or
advertisements.

so far my son hates it and rather do pen and paper tests, but thats
good also right?
