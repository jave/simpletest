* simple math tutorial test for kids
its supposed to work a bit like chatting with a bot
and could maybe be elnodeified

i looked around for an existing solution but didnt find any that
wasnt replete with jumping penguins, flash animations, or
advertisements.

so far my son hates it and rather do pen and paper tests, but thats
good also right?

** example
You start out like this:
01:     5 + 0  =  5      

and after answering questions for a while, it looks like this:

01:     5 + 0  =  5      R 
02:    13 - 2  =  11     R 
03:    3 + 12  =  15     R 
04:    40 / 8  =  5      R 
05:     3 * 9  =  27     R 
06:     5 - 5  =  0      R 
07:     6 * 2  =  12     R 
08:     0 * 9  =  0      R 
09:     8 * 2  =  16     R 
10:     6 + 3  =  9      R 
11:     3 * 2  =  6      R 
12:     1 - 0  =  1      R 
13:     1 * 8  =  8      R 
14:     7 - 3  =  4      R 
15:   15 + 11  =  26     R 
16:     1 * 5  =  5      R 
17:     3 - 1  =  2      R 
18:    5 * 10  =  50     R 
19:    12 - 7  =  5      R 
20:    42 / 7  =  6      R 
21:   19 + 10  =  29     R 
22:     4 / 4  =           

theres colours and stuff in the live version!

If you make a misstake you get an "F"

08:     0 * 9  =  9      F

you can go back and correct your answer so you get an "R"

08:     0 * 9  =  0      R
